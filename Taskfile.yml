# Environment Variables will be set with the following precedence (from high to low):
# .env.local.<env>
#     Local environment variables that are specific to an environment have the highest priority.
#     For example, to test a staging environment, put any staging-specific variables in
#     .env.local.stg. These variables will be set first and will not be overridden by
#     variables set in other .env files. A common use case for this is to set specific
#     variables used for testing personal staging sites in a provider/consumer configuration.
#
# .env
#     Local environment variables that should be common across all environments when doing local
#     development. In the most common case, this will have the full 'dev' configuration.
#
#  envs/.env.<env>
#     Default environment variables for each of the dev, stg and prod environments. If an
#     environment variable is not set in any of the local .env files, the default value from this
#     file will be used. These default values are the non-secret values that will be used for
#     configuration of the shared stg and prod apps managed through CI/CD.
